# Careers in Computer Science

## Software Development Manager
A software developement manager plans and manages all activities related to writing programs and coding. They must be familiar with all the policies, procedures, and technical issues related to software programming. The software development manager is the go-to person when it comes to developing and the developers of a project. They are in charge of coordinating the activities of the software developing team of a company or project. 

### **Duties and Reponsibilities**

### **Required Education**
To become a software development manager, a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering, or Information Technology is required. As a manager, employers may require a Masters degree or Masters of Business Administration for senior level positions. Employers also prefer managers with lots of experience in the field as the job requires extensive training. 

### **Required Skills and Qualities**

#### Technical 
* strong technical and analytic skills 
* expert knowledge of programming languages, platforms, and methods 
* troubleshooting skills 
* assess complex programming applications 
* adaptable to keep up with new software and systems 

#### Non-Technical 
* excellent written and verbal communication skills 
* collaboration skills to work with others in the team 
* strong budgeting and managerial skills 
* leadership skills to mentor, train, and evaluate 

### **Example Jobs** 

#### Entry Level
#### Mid Level 
#### Senior Level 

### **Example Post Secondary Education**

#### Entrance Requirments 
* six Grade 12 U and/or M level courses
* must include: 
  * Advanced Functions
  * Calculus and Vectors 
  * Any Grade 12 U English 
  * One other 4 U course 
* Average in the low 90s

The Intermediate Value theorem and approximate solutions to equations. Derivatives, linear approximation, and Newton's method. The Mean Value theorem and error bounds. Applications of the Mean Value theorem, Taylor polynomials and Taylor's theorem, Big-O notation. |
| CS 136 - Algorithm Design and Data Abstraction | This course builds on the techniques and patterns learned in CS 135 while making the transition to use an imperative language. It introduces the design and analysis of algorithms, the management of information, and the programming mechanisms and methodologies required in implementations. |
| MATH 136 - Linear Algebra I | Systems of linear equations, matrix algebra, elementary matrices, computational issues. Real n-space, vector spaces and subspaces, basis and dimension, rank of a matrix, linear transformations, and matrix representations. Determinants, eigenvalues and diagonalization, applications. |

| CS 246 - Object-Oriented Software Development | Introduction to object-oriented programming and to tools and techniques for software development. Designing, coding, debugging, testing, and documenting medium-sized programs: reading specifications and designing software to implement them; selecting appropriate data structures and control structures. 
| CS 245 - Logic and Computation | Logic as a tool for representation, reasoning, and computation. Propositional and predicate logic. Formalizing the notions of correct and incorrect reasoning, defining what is computable, and exploring the limits of computation. Godel's Incompleteness Theorem. Applications of logic to computer science. | 
| STAT 230 - Probability | Introduction to probability models including sample spaces, mutually exclusive and independent events, conditional probability and Bayes' Theorem. The named distributionsare used to model real phenomena. Students learn how to calculate and interpret means, variances and covariances particularly for the named distributions.
| CS 240 - Data Structures and Data Management | Introduction to widely used and effective methods of data organization, focusing on data structures, their algorithms, and the performance of these algorithms. Specific topics include priority queues, sorting, dictionaries, data structures for text processing.|
