# Careers in Computer Science

## Software Development Manager
A software developement manager plans and manages all activities related to writing programs and coding. They must be familiar with all the policies, procedures, and technical issues related to software programming. The software development manager is the go-to person when it comes to developing and the developers of a project. They are in charge of coordinating the activities of the software developing team of a company or project. 

### **Duties and Reponsibilities**

### **Required Education**
To become a software development manager, a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering, or Information Technology is required. As a manager, employers may require a Masters degree or Masters of Business Administration for senior level positions. Employers also prefer managers with lots of experience in the field as the job requires extensive training. 

### **Required Skills and Qualities**

#### Technical 
* strong technical and analytic skills 
* expert knowledge of programming languages, platforms, and methods 
* troubleshooting skills 
* assess complex programming applications 
* adaptable to keep up with new software and systems 

#### Non-Technical 
* excellent written and verbal communication skills 
* collaboration skills to work with others in the team 
* strong budgeting and managerial skills 
* leadership skills to mentor, train, and evaluate 

### **Example Jobs**

#### First Year Programs 
| **Course Code and Name** | **Description** |
| --------------- | ----------------|
| CS 135 - Designing Functional Programs | An introduction to the fundamentals of computer science through the application of elementary programming patterns in the functional style of programming. | 
MATH 135 - Algebra | An introduction to the language of mathematics and proof techniques through a study of the basic algebraic systems of mathematics: the integers, the integers modulo n, the rational numbers, the real numbers, the complex numbers and polynomials. 
MATH 137 - Calculus I | Absolute values and inequalities. Sequences and their limits. Introduction to series. Limits of functions and continuity. The Intermediate Value theorem and approximate solutions to equations. Derivatives, linear approximation, and Newton's method. The Mean Value theorem and error bounds. Applications of the Mean Value theorem, Taylor polynomials and Taylor's theorem, Big-O notation. 
CS 136 - Algorithm Design and Data Abstraction | This course builds on the techniques and patterns learned in CS 135 while making the transition to use an imperative language. It introduces the design and analysis of algorithms, the management of information, and the programming mechanisms and methodologies required in implementations.
